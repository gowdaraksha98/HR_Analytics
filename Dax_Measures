● Presence % is calculated by dividing the number of present days by the total working days. This measure ensures that employees marked as present or working remotely 
contribute to the attendance percentage.  

Presence % = DIVIDE([Present Days],[Total Working Days],0)  

● Present Days calculates the total number of present days, including both physically present employees and those working from home. It counts the occurrences of "P" 
(Present) while also adding the work-from-home count.  

Present Days =  
var presentdays = CALCULATE(COUNT(FinalData[Value]), FinalData[Value] ="P")  
RETURN  
presentdays + SUM(FinalData[WFH Count])  

● SL % calculates the percentage of sick leave days relative to the total number of present days.  

SL % = DIVIDE([SL Count],[Present Days],0)  

● SL Count sums up all recorded sick leave occurrences in the dataset.  

SL Count = SUM(FinalData[SL Count])  

● Total Working Days is derived by counting the total number of recorded days while excluding weekends and holidays, ensuring only actual working days are considered.  

Total Working Days =  
var totaldays = COUNT(FinalData[Value])  
var nonworkdays = CALCULATE(COUNT(FinalData[Value]), FinalData[Value] in {"WO","HO"})  
RETURN  
totaldays - nonworkdays  

● WFH Count aggregates all recorded instances of employees working from home.  

WFH Count = SUM(FinalData[WFH Count])  

● WFH% determines the percentage of work-from-home days relative to the total present days, providing insights into remote work trends.  

WFH% = DIVIDE([WFH Count],[Present Days],0)
